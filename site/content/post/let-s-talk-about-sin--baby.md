This will be a 3-part dive into the subject of sin as seen throughout the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament.

Let's get started

### In the Beginning

In the first three chapters of the Bible, in the book we call Genesis, we have two creation accounts. The first one is from Genesis 1:1 to the first half of 2:4, and the second one starts in the second half of verse 4 and continues until the end of Chapter 3.

In the first account, God is portrayed as transcendent, not very personal, almost aloof.

In the second account, God is portrayed  we see Him coming down, meeting with the humans face-to-face, even helping Adam find a partner that is right for him.

In the second account, there are two trees with special powers, there is also a talking animal, namely a snake. In this account, God is always referred to by the name that would later be revealed to Moses at the burning bush, Yahweh or _YHWH_ as it is written in Hebrew. In the first account (as is consistent with this writer's style wherever his content shows up elsewhere in the Bible), there are no "magical" trees and no talking animals. There are no angels and, for this author, there is no direct contact with the divine. It always happens through priests. In the first account, God is always referred to as _Elohim_.

In the beginning, we see that God created the heavens and the earth. The story mentions six times that God notices that what He has done is good. In Hebrew, the word here is "_tov_" which can have several meanings: good, beautiful, or working the way itâ€™s supposed to.

For the Jews, this wouldn't necessarily denote a sense of moral goodness or even perfection, but the idea that everything He made was good in itself, and at the same time working together with everything else the way it's supposed to work.

We also see that from the very beginning, it was God's plan for humans to "subdue"(Gen 1:28) which can also mean to "climb above" in Hebrew. In other words, from the very beginning, struggle was "baked into" the very fabric of our existence in this universe.

Scholars tell us that Genesis chapters 1 - 3 actually contains two separate creation accounts. As you will see if you pull up Genesis chapter 2 in the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV), half way through Gen 2: 4, they have a new heading: "Another Account of the Creation". These two accounts were written down at different times, by different people for very different reasons, but that's something I'll hopefully cover some other time.
