This will be a 3-part dive into the subject of sin as seen throughout the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament.

The beginning seems like as good a place as any to start, so here we go...

### In the Beginning

In the first three chapters of the Bible, in the book we call Genesis, we have two creation accounts. The first one is from [Genesis 1:1 to the first half of 2:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A1+-+2%3A4&version=NRSV), and the second one starts in the [second half of verse 4 and continues until the end of Chapter 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A4+-+3%3A24&version=NRSV). 

(Confusing, right? Just keep in mind that chapter and verse divisions weren't originally in the Bible, they were added sometime in the 16th century.)

In the beginning, as the first story goes, God created the heavens and the earth. Six times in the story God notices that what He has done is "good". In Hebrew, the word here is "_tov_" which can have several meanings: good, beautiful, or working the way itâ€™s supposed to.

For the Jews, this wouldn't necessarily denote a sense of moral goodness or even perfection, but the idea that everything He made was good in itself, and at the same time working together with everything else the way it's supposed to work.

We also see that from the very beginning, that it was God's plan for humans to "subdue" (Gen 1:28) which can also mean to "climb above" in Hebrew. In other words, from the very beginning, struggle was "baked into" the very fabric of our existence in this universe. Why else would humans have needed to "subdue" anything? Surprising, right? That's because we have this idea that what God created was some kind of paradise and in paradise, everything is perfect, there's no struggle, no work, no "blood, sweat and tears".

Scholars tell us that Genesis chapters 1 - 3 actually contains two separate creation accounts. As you will see if you pull up Genesis chapter 2 in the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV), half way through Gen 2: 4, they have a new heading: "Another Account of the Creation". These two accounts were written down at different times, by different people for very different reasons, but that's something I'll hopefully cover some other time.
