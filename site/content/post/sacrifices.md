### The Old Testament Sacrifices

The types of sacrifices described and prescribed in the Old Testament were many and varied. However, there are three main categories: animals, grain, and money.

To be clear, the purpose of sacrifice in the Old Testament wasn't mainly for the expiation of sins, although many sacrifices did have that effect.

According to the Judaism 101 website: 

> The word "qorbanot" is usually translated as "sacrifices" or "offerings"; however, both of these terms suggest a loss of something or a giving up of something, and although that is certainly a part of the ritual, that is not at all the literal meaning of the Hebrew word. The word qorbanot comes from the [root](http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/root.htm) Qof-Reish-Beit, which means "to draw near," and indicates the primary purpose of offerings: to draw us near to [G-d](http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/g-d.htm).
