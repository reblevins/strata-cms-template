### The Old Testament Sacrifices

For most Christians, the idea that the Old Testament sacrifices were for making amends for guilt or sins is so tied up with what Jesus did on the cross, that it's almost impossible for us to think of it differently. Most of us were taught that the sacrifices were required by God to satisfy His justice. A [blog post](https://thebibleproject.com/blog/animal-sacrifice-really/ "Animal Sacrifice? Really?") on [The Bible Project](https://thebibleproject.com/ "The Bible Project website") website sums up what most people believe:

> God is holy and perfect. You are not. Therefore, God is angry at you, hates you even, and so he has to kill you. But, because he’s merciful, he’ll let you bring this animal to him and will have the animal killed instead of you.

Thankfully for us, as our ill-conceived version of the story goes, Jesus steps in and takes our place. God kills Him instead of us, satisfying His, uh God's justice. Not Jesus-God but God-God who's in heaven. Ok, I'm being a bit cheeky now, but this does serve to illuminate some of the holes in this theory and also how confusing this whole thing can be for non-Christians.

According to the Judaism 101 website:

> The word "qorbanot" is usually translated as "sacrifices" or "offerings"; however, both of these terms suggest a loss of something or a giving up of something, and although that is certainly a part of the ritual, that is not at all the literal meaning of the Hebrew word. The word qorbanot comes from the [root](http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/root.htm) Qof-Reish-Beit, which means "to draw near," and indicates the primary purpose of offerings: to draw us near to [G-d](http://www.jewfaq.org/defs/g-d.htm).

The types of sacrifices described and prescribed in the Old Testament were many and varied. However, there are three main categories: animals, grain, and money.
