The beginning it where most things begin, but not this story. But, don't worry we'll get to the beginning in due time.

For millennia, many people - shamans, priests, religious leaders, regular folk, astronomers/astrologers (for most of history these were the same profession) - just assumed that the universe was static, it had always existed and probably always would.  Even into the modern day (from The Enlightenment onward), many scientists also assumed that the universe had always existed.

Then in the 1920's, a man named Edwin Hubble pointed his telescope at the stars and discovered that the universe is actually expanding. Trace the motion of the galaxies we see backwards and at some point in the past, they all converge on a single point. A beginning. 

But scientists don't like the universe having a beginning and not because they are all flaming atheists who don't like the idea of God (well, to be honest, some are), it's because it isn't tidy. You wouldn't think so walking past the average professor's / scientist's office, but scientists like things to be tidy. They want something to be self-contained, a closed system if you will.

The idea that the universe had a beginning kind of confirmed the first words from the Bible: "In the beginning..." I say "kind of" because those same scientists (both Christian and non-Christian alike) were pretty certain that you would have to dial back the universe quite a long ways -  roughly 15 billion years - to get "back to the beginning".

But... we're getting ahead of ourselves (or behind ourselves... frankly this figure of speech is getting tedious). Rewind a few years to a man named Nicolaus Copernicus.
