How to read and interpret the Bible is an age-old question that has been around as long as there were stories to listen to or to read.

The very first interpreters of the Jewish _torah_ (what we Christians call the Pentateuch, or first five books of our Old Testament) struggled with this. For them, there were four fundamental ways of looking at and interpreting scripture:

1. The literal, "plain" meaning.
2. The deep (allegoric: hidden or symbolic)Â meaning.
3. The comparative meaning, i.e., how is this handled subject in other verses in the Bible.
4. And the secret or esoteric meaning.

For these original interpreters, the Bible never, ever mean what it actually said. They reasoned that since it was from God, it must have a much deeper meaning than the "plain" meaning of the text. For them, the literal meaning was the least interesting meaning.

For many Christians, today, it seems as though a literal reading has become the default, in fact the only way to read the Bible. "Don't interpret", as the thinking goes, "just read the 'plain meaning' of the text." If you don't, you're somehow missing the mark, or might even be labeled a heretic.

Others balk at the idea of reading the Bible literally. For them, it's all allegorical and metaphorical, nothing really happened exactly the way it is described, especially not those miracles. "Frankly", as their thinking goes, "miracles are rather an embarrassment to thoughtful, modern people."

For the early church, there were, similarly four levels of interpretation possible: the literal, the allegorical/symbolic, the moral and the eschatological. A verse of scripture could be interpreted via one or more of these levels and it could potentially have no literal meaning at all and be purely metaphorical or symbolic ([source](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Catholic-Church-so-opposed-to-heliocentrism-for-example-in-the-Renaissance-Why-did-they-not-simply-claim-that-God-lived-in-the-Sun-so-we-go-around-Him)).

A good example of this, is the reaction in 1616 from Cardinal Bellarmine to the writings of Galileo that the earth and planets really did revolve around the sun:

> I say that if there were a true demonstration that the sun is at the centre of the world and the earth in the third heaven, and that the sun does not circle the earth but the earth circles the sun, then one would have to proceed with great care in explaining the Scriptures that appear contrary, and say rather that we do not understand them than that what is demonstrated is false.

But lets back up for a moment and get a broader picture of things.

### (Con)text determines interpretation

Anytime we approach a piece of communication whether it be a letter, an article, a book, a cartoon or for that matter a meme, we, consciously or unconsciously make a decision about how to read and interpret that text.

Let's say that you are single and dating a woman who lives in another part of the country. And because she is old-fashioned she likes to send you actual, physical letters (a lost art, if you ask me). One day, you go to your mailbox, you pull out your letters, and, oh joy, you have received a letter from her. Something strikes you as odd right off the bat, the envelope is more the standard business style and your address as well as her return address is printed instead of handwritten.

You are already relishing the irony as you open the envelope and withdraw letter. The wry smile on your lips quickly fades, though, as you begin to read the first line. It begins

**Dear sir/madam:**

Ok, a bit odd, but maybe still meant ironically. However, as you continue to read, the entire letter appears to be written in a formal manner. What is going through your mind at this point? Has she lost her mind, did she mistakenly send me the wrong letter, is she breaking up with me?

At the very least, this is unexpected, because you approached the letter expecting a certain style and tone, but you got something entirely different.

In our day-to-day lives, we usually know how to interpret any given piece of communication we come across.

_We would never read a cartoon and think it was intended to be taken seriously._

_We don't listen to the nightly talkshows to be thoughtfully and unbiasedly informed about the days events._

_We don't (normally) open a letter from the IRS expecting to get a good laugh._

In other words, when we read or listen to something, how we interpret it is a choice we make.

**We make the same choices when we approach the Bible.**

In other other words, a literal reading of the Bible is an exegetical choice, it's not a given.

### Interpretation isn't an option

You may have been told once or twice: "just read the text, don't interpret". This, however, is impossible. We are constantly interpreting everything we see, read and hear, every single day and most of that is in a language and culture that we can understand.

Anyone who has ever been in a relationship can attest to this fact. How many arguments have been started when our loved one or spouse says something and we misinterpret it. And these are people who speak the same language as us, and, often share the same culture, even the same house!

Now, let's go back to the Bible and it's many layers.

**Language**

First of all, most of us are not reading the text in the original language, we are reading a translation, which is actually, you guessed it, an _interpretation_ which has already been done for us.

**Ambiguity**

Let's add another layer: The original Hebrew that most of the Old Testament was written in, didn't make use of punctuation, capital letters or even vowels. On top of this, Hebrew can be very ambiguous at times. Thankfully, the men and women who translate the Bible for us, are extremely well trained in deciphering the original Hebrew giving us a fairly accurate _interpretation._

**Culture**

Let's add yet another layer: culture. It may seem obvious, but we are separated from the original writers and audience of the Bible by a great culture gap which further complicates our ability to understand the Bible's meaning. Anyone who has ever lived in a cross-cultural situation, whether in your own country or in another country, will know how difficult culture can make it for us to understand each other.

**Time**

Again, this may be obvious, but we are also separated from the people of the Bible by a great expanse of time. Think about how much our modern understanding of science, hygiene, etc. has come in just a few hundred years. Just a couple of hundred years ago, many people still believe that diseases were caused by [miasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory), a noxious form of "bad air". This is not to say that we are so much more sophisticated than the ancient people of Biblical times, we simply have a vastly different worldview than them.

Hopefully, you're starting to get a sense of the complexity of it all and how far removed we are from any kind of _literal_ reading of the text.

### Why read the Bible?

For most people, the question of how to read the Bible actually follows from a much more important question: _Why read the Bible?_

Most people who read the Bible don't read it to study history, although plenty may enjoy history, some may read to study the Bible itself, to help others understand it better. Most people read it to gain meaning in life, to be inspired, to gain encouragement in difficult times, and to generally help make sense of life.

So, to circle back around to where we began, I suggest to you that most people don't actually read the Bible literally. They read it for the deeper meaning, hoping to gain some insights for there daily lives, or maybe even some "secret" knowledge.

### So, how does this help us?

That's a good question. How does
