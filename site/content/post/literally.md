The word literal gets thrown around a lot in modern-day English. You'll here or read people saying things like:

> "OMG, I am, literally, dying over here."

or

> "He, literally, said that?"

or

> "I am, literally, reading the Bible here."

Ok, maybe not that last one, but that is a good segway.

For many people, it seems as though it has become doctrine to read the Bible literally. In other words, as the thinking goes, don't interpret, just read the "plain meaning" of the text. If you don't, you're somehow missing the mark, or might even be labeled a heretic.

Others balk at the idea of reading the Bible literally. For them, it's all allegorical and metaphorical, nothing really happened exactly the way it is described, especially not those miracles. Frankly, as their thinking goes, miracles are rather an embarrassment to thoughtful, modern people.

How to read and interpret the Bible, is an age-old question. It has been around as long as there were stories to listen to or to read. The very first interpreters, both oral and written, of the Jewish _torah_ (what we Christians call the pentateuch, or first five books of our Old Testament) struggled with this. For them, there were four fundamental ways of looking at and interpreting scripture:

1. The literal, "plain" meaning.
2. The deep (allegoric: hidden or symbolic)Â meaning.
3. The comparative meaning, i.e., how is this handled subject in other verses in the Bible.
4. And the secret or esoteric meaning.

For these original interpreters, the Bible never, ever mean what it actually said. They reasoned that since it was from God, it must have a much deeper meaning than the "plain" meaning of the text. For them, the literal meaning was the least interesting meaning.

For the early church, there were, similarly four levels of interpretation possible: the literal, the allegorical/symbolic, the moral and the eschatological. A verse of scripture could be interpreted via one or more of these levels and it could potentially have no literal meaning at all and be purely metaphorical or symbolic ([source](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Catholic-Church-so-opposed-to-heliocentrism-for-example-in-the-Renaissance-Why-did-they-not-simply-claim-that-God-lived-in-the-Sun-so-we-go-around-Him)).

A good example of this, is the reaction in 1616 from Cardinal Bellarmine to the writings of Galileo that the earth and planets really did revolve around the sun:

> I say that if there were a true demonstration that the sun is at the centre of the world and the earth in the third heaven, and that the sun does not circle the earth but the earth circles the sun, then one would have to proceed with great care in explaining the Scriptures that appear contrary, and say rather that we do not understand them than that what is demonstrated is false.

But lets back up for a moment and get a broader picture of things.

### (Con)text determines interpretation

Anytime we approach a piece of communication whether it be a letter, an article, a book, a cartoon or for that matter a meme, we, consciously or unconsciously make a decision about how to read and interpret that text.

Let's say that you are single and dating a woman who lives in another part of the country. And because she is old-fashioned she likes to send you actual, physical letters (a lost art, if you ask me). One day, you go to your mailbox, you pull out your letters, and, oh joy, you have received a letter from her. Something strikes you as odd right off the bat, the envelope is more the standard business style and your address as well as her return address is printed instead of handwritten.

You are already relishing the irony as you open the envelope and withdraw letter. The wry smile on your lips quickly fades, though, as you begin to read the first line. It begins

**Dear sir/madam:**

Ok, a bit odd, but maybe still meant ironically. However, as you continue to read, the entire letter appears to be written in a formal manner. What is going through your mind at this point? Has she lost her mind, did she mistakenly send me the wrong letter, is she breaking up with me?

At the very least, this is unexpected, because you approached the letter expecting a certain style and tone, but you got something entirely different.

In our day-to-day lives, we usually know how to interpret any given piece of communication we come across.

_We would never read a cartoon and think it was intended to be taken seriously._

_We don't listen to the nightly talkshows to be thoughtfully and unbiasedly informed about the days events._

_We don't (normally) open a letter from the IRS expecting to get a good laugh._

In other words, when we read or listen to something, how we interpret it is a choice we make.

**We make the same choices when we approach the Bible.**

In other other words, a literal reading of the Bible is an exegetical choice, it's not a given.
